The high proportion of complex sentences indicates a preference for nuanced phrasing.\n    *   **Syntactic Patterns:** Predominantly Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure.  There's a noticeable use of relative clauses (\"she's been helping me,\" \"she lays down on my chest\").  A higher frequency of embedded clauses suggests a tendency towards narrative flow.\n    *   **Example:** \"If it wasn't for her my last major episode would've ended drastically bad, I only came out of bed to take care of her and play a bit, and everytime she sees me crying almost immediately she lays down on my chest.\" (This exemplifies the use of relative clauses and embedded phrasing.)\n\n2.  **Clause Choreography:**\n    *   **Subordinate Clause Frequency:** 18% subordinate clauses. This is a relatively high percentage, indicating a tendency to use clauses to add detail, emphasis, or clarification.\n    *   **Coordination vs. Subordination Ratios:** 70% Coordination, 30% Subordination.  The text leans heavily on coordination, creating a sense of logical flow.\n    *   **Dependent Clause Patterns:**  A mix of relative clauses (e.g., \"she's been helping me\") and adverbs modifying verbs (e.g., \"she lays down\").\n\n3.  **Punctuation Symphony:**\n    *   **Punctuation Count:** 38.
